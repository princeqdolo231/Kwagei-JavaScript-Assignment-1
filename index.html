        <h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
        JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output.
        
        To define a function, you must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ). Then you have to write the function logic between curly brackets { }
        
        Here is an example of how to write a function in JavaScript:
        <pre>
          <code>
            EXAMPLE:
            
            function addTwoNumbers(x, y) {
                   return x + y;
            }
          </code>
        </pre>
        
        <strong>There’s a lot going on in the example above, so let’s look at each part individually.</strong>
        
        <strong>“Function”</strong> is the keyword required to actually start declaring a function
        “addTwoNumbers” is the function’s name, which is customizable. Function names can contain letters, numbers, and certain special characters, just like variables.
        (x, y) are parameters, which are variable names for the inputs the function will accept. These parameters are also referred to as arguments.
        “Return” is the keyword that exits the function and shares an optional value outside
    The code that the function will execute mut be put inside of curly brackets { }
        
        <h1>Using functions</h1>
        Once a JS function is defined (declared), you can use it by referencing its name with parentheses ( ) right after. Note that a function doesn’t have to have parameters - they can simply be left blank in the parentheses:
        
        <pre>
          <code>
            EXAMPLE:
            
            function greetThePlanet() {
                   return "Hello world!";
            }
        ​
                  greetThePlanet();
                  OUTPUT
                  "Hello world!"
          </code>
        </pre>
        
        There can be zero, one, or multiple arguments in a function.<br> 
        In the example above, the function "greetThePlanet" simply returns the phrase "Hello World!", and it doesn't require any parameters (arguments) in order to do so.
        
        However, if a function does have parameters, you’ll need to provide values inside the parentheses when using the function:
        
        <pre>
          <code>
            EXAMPLE
             function square(number) {
               return number * number;
        }
        ​
                square(16);
                OUTPUT
                256
          </code>
        </pre>
        
        In the example above, you have to provide a number inside of the parentheses in order for the function to work and to receive a proper output. Otherwise, your code won’t work and you’ll get an error message.
        
        If your function takes more than one argument, simply separate them with a comma inside of the parentheses. <br>
        You can refer to the "addTwoNumbers" function at the top of this page for an example.

        <script type="text/JavaScript">
            1. Day of the Week

            Create a program that takes a number representing a day (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.) 
            and logs to the console the corresponding day of the week using a switch statement.


            2. Eligibility to Vote

            Create a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age. 
            The program should prompt the user to enter their age and then display a message indicating whether they are eligible to vote or not.

            3. Grade Calculator

            Build a grade calculator that takes student's score as input (a number between 0 and 100) 
            and alerts their grade based on the following criteria using conditional statements.

            - If the score is between 90 and 100, the grade is "A."
            - If the score is between 80 and 89, the grade is "B."
            - If the score is between 70 and 79, the grade is "C."
            - If the score is between 60 and 69, the grade is "D."
            - If the score is below 60, the grade is "F."

            4. Driving License Eligibility

            Create a program that checks if a person is eligible for a 
            driver's license based on their age. The program should prompt the user to enter their age, and then display a message indicating whether they are eligible for a driver's license or not.

            5. Age Group Classifier

            Write a program that classifies a person into different age groups based on 
            their age. The program should prompt the user to enter their age and then display 
            a message indicating which age group they belong to (e.g., child, teenager, adult, senior). Use a Switch statement
